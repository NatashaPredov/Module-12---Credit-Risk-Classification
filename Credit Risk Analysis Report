Credit Risk Analysis Report

(1) Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis. 

The purpose of this analysis is to create binary prediction models to provide clear outcomes on if a loan is high risk or not to reduce the number of high risk loans. 
The core purpose of the model is benefical for all compaines to ensure that the measures are taken to effectively avoid potentially risky situations for the company. 
Without this model, organizations would just be making educated guesses and it is always better to base ideas and conclusions on outcomes from data. 

(2) Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of both machine learning models.
- Original Data
  - 
- Testing Data
  - 

(3) Summarize the results from the machine learning models. Compare the two versions of the dataset predictions. Include your recommendation, if any, for the model to use the original vs. the resampled data. If you donâ€™t recommend either model, justify your reasoning.
In the real world, from doing some additional reading it was highlighted tha the model expected to have better performance is the test set. By using two models, you work towards eliminating data discrepencies. 
I would reccomend that moving forward, the company continues to hydrate the models with data that it can learn from. In addition to this, models should perform better on data it has seen before therefor I would reccomend traning the model on data on extensive data it has seen to ensure that predictions are the most accurate.
